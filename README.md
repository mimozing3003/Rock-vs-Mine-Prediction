# Sonar Signal Classification: Rock vs Mine

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository presents a supervised machine learning study on **sonar signal classification**, distinguishing between **underwater mines** and **rocks**.  
Using the **Sonar dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**, the project investigates feature extraction and classification performance with logistic regression, establishing a baseline for more advanced models.

---

## 🎯 Research Motivation
The detection of underwater mines is a critical task in **naval defense, maritime security, and autonomous underwater exploration**.  
Traditional manual methods are risky, time-consuming, and costly.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning can provide automated sonar interpretation**, serving as a foundation for real-world applications such as:
- Naval mine countermeasures  
- Safe submarine navigation  
- Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)  
- Oceanographic surveys

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs.+rocks)  
- **Size:** 208 instances × 60 features  
- **Features:** Energy of sonar signals at different frequencies  
- **Target Labels:**  
  - `R` → Rock  
  - `M` → Mine  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded sonar CSV dataset  
   - Normalized feature values  
   - Encoded target labels  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Statistical distribution of features  
   - Correlation heatmaps  

3. **Modeling**
   - Baseline model: Logistic Regression  
   - Train/test split: 80/20  
   - Accuracy & confusion matrix evaluation  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** ~83%  
- Model demonstrates promising capability for real-world classification but leaves scope for robustness improvements.

| Metric            | Score |
|-------------------|-------|
| Accuracy          | 0.83  |
| Precision (Mine)  | 0.82  |
| Recall (Mine)     | 0.84  |
